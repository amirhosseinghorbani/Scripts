This script first validates the IP, then checks its reachability by pinging the IP, and then prints the result in the output.
1-Create a file with a .sh extension
2-Add an execute permission to the file to avoid permission denied errors during execution (chmod +x filename.sh)
3-Use the ./ (dot slash)  notation and run the shell script by name in the Terminal window (./ipvalidation.sh)

#!/bin/bash

while [ -z $IP ]
do
read -p "Please Enter IP ADDRESS: " IP
IP=`echo $IP | tr -d [:alpha:]`
DOT=`echo $IP | tr -d [:digit:] | tr -d [:space:] | wc -c`
done

if [ $DOT -eq 3 ]
then
	for i in 1 2 3 4 
	do 
		VAR=`echo $IP | cut -d "." -f $i`
		if [ $VAR -gt 255 ]
		then 
			echo "IP is not Valid"
			exit 1
		fi
	done
	echo "IP is Validated!" 
	ping -c 1 $IP >> /dev/null
	if [ $? -eq 0 ]
	then 
		echo "IP is Pingable!"
	else 
		echo "IP is not Pingable"
	fi 
	exit 0
else
	echo "IP is not valid, please try again"
	exit 1 
fi
