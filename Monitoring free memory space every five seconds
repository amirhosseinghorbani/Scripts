This script checks the free memory space of ram every 5 seconds and records it in the output file along with the date and time.
1-Create a file with a .sh extension
2-Add an execute permission to the file to avoid permission denied errors during execution (chmod +x filename.sh)
3-Use the ./ (dot slash)  notation and run the shell script by name in the Terminal window (./memory.sh)

#!/bin/bash

while true

do

DATE=`date +%Y/%m/%d-%H:%M:%S`

  echo -e "===========================" "\n$DATE" >> /root/MemoryReport.log

cut -d $'\n' -f 2 /proc/meminfo >> /root/MemoryReport.log

sleep 5
