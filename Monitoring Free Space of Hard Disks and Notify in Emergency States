This script monitors the available disk space and sends a warning email to root as soon as the disk usage reaches 80%.
1-Create a file with a .sh extension
2-Add an execute permission to the file to avoid permission denied errors during execution (chmod +x filename.sh)
3-Use the ./ (dot slash)  notation and run the shell script by name in the Terminal window (./harddisk.sh)

#!/bin/bash

while true

do

AVAILABE=`df -TH | grep /dev/sda3 | awk '{ print $6 }' | cut -d "%" -f1`

if [ $AVAILABE -ge 80 ]

then

    echo "Hard Disk Usage is: %$AVAILABE" |mail -s "Disk Usage Alert" root@localhost
