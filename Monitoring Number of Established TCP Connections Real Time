1-Create a file with a .sh extension
2-Add an execute permission to the file to avoid permission denied errors during execution (chmod +x filename.sh)
3-Use the ./ (dot slash)  notation and run the shell script by name in the Terminal window (./Tcpconnection.sh)

#!/bin/bash

while true
do 
	TCP=`netstat -pentual | grep ESTABLISHED | wc -l`

	echo "`date +%Y/%m/%d-%H:%M:%S`: Number of TCP Connections are: $TCP" >> /root/TCPConnection_`date +%Y%m%d`.log

       sleep 1	
done
